# Indian GDP Analysis in 2020 using Tableau
The goal of this project is to investigate the complex relationships leading to a decline in GDP in the year 2020.Our focus is on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as a primary factor influencing the economic decline. To conduct this analysis, we employ interactive visual analytics using Tableau, providing a comprehensive platform to report and explore the multifaceted factors contributing to the observed event. Through this comparative study, we aim to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships between people, organizations, and external factors that shape complex events, shedding light on the broader implications of economic downturns in the context of global events.

## DATASET
Employed three distinct datasets available in Kaggle to construct a comprehensive dashboard that delves into various factors influencing India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
• The first dataset is India Tourism 2014-2020: It provides valuable insights into various aspects of tourism, such as the number of foreign visitors, their countries of origin, and the duration of their stay.
• The second data set is Exports and Imports of India 1997-2022: This dataset offers a comprehensive view of India’s import and export activities from July 1997 to 2022. The dataset is instrumental in understanding the dynamics of trade patterns, economic activities, and trade balances.
• Lastly, the unemployment data set - Unemployment in India:  It provides insights into unemployment rates for every Indian state. The dataset covers key variables such as the frequency of reporting, unemployment rates, employed percentages, and labor participation rates.



## VISUALIZATIONS
### GDP Growth over the years
By analyzing GDP growth over time, the visualization Fig. 1
provides an overview of India’s economic development. The
graph shows differences in growth rates from 2010 to 2022.
The graph depicts the ability to recover and the potential
inherent in a country’s economic structure, ranging from
the bounce of successful years to the turbulent downturn in
the year 2020. Every change, no matter how big or small,
reveals information about societal changes, global dynamics,
policy choices, and unforeseen calamities like the COVID-19
pandemic.

### Unemployment rates
The visual representation in Fig. 2 of unemployment rates
in 2020 conveys a message of social unrest. The sudden rises
and declines in jobless rates over months reflect the fluctuating
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country’s labor
force. It illustrates the hardships of job loss, financial strain,
and the struggle to make ends meet amid a worldwide crisis.

### Import-Export Trend
The graph Fig. 3 illustrating import and export patterns
offers an interesting description of India’s economic relations
with other countries from the year 2010 to 2023. This dynamic
graph reveals the complex pattern of trade dynamics of imports
and exports. The import-export trade dropped in the year 2020
due to the pandemic but had the highest trade in the year 2021.

### Tourism Revenue
The tourism sector’s journey is represented in the graph
that shows the total revenue earned by tourism from 2013
to 2021. Revenue has been increasing steadily until 2019
followed by a noticeable drop in 2020 and a slight rise in
2021. The tourism industry suffered greatly as a result of
the pandemic-related restrictions, which included broad travel
bans, visa suspensions, and company closures. This resulted
in lower revenue and slower growth. The small increase in
2021 represents the start of recovery. Hotels, restaurants, and
other tourism-related businesses saw shutdowns or capacity
reductions, which further hampered income, increased the
financial burden on nearby areas dependent on tourism, and
increased job losses in the industry.

## Conclusion
Through our analysis of India’s GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, import-export
trends, and tourism revenue using visualizations, it was clear
that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on India’s
economy. An event as major as the pandemic impacted all of
the economic indicators that we analyzed. Further exploration
of other indicators would likely further prove the strong
correlation between this event and India’s economic indicators.
